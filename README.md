Walmart Regional Product Mix and Profitability Analysis


** Project Background

Walmart is the largest retailer in the United States, serving a wide variety of customers across thousands of stores. This project analyzes a multi-year, multi-region dataset of 1,500 Walmart stores to answer a critical business question:

How can Walmart optimize its product selection for each region, considering local customer demographics, in order to maximize profits and reduce financial losses caused by product returns?

The analysis is designed to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations for regional managers, product and category teams, and operational leaders at Walmart.





** Executive Summary

- Total Sales from 2016 to 2025: 21 billion US dollars across all regions and product categories.

- Grocery is the leading product category in every region, responsible for 58–65% of sales.

- Clothing has the highest return rate (8.4%), with Electronics also elevated (7%).

- Total value lost to returns across all product categories: 751 million US dollars.

- Customer Demographics: Most sales come from customers aged 45 to 64 and those with an annual income of $60,000 to $80,000.

- Profitability is significantly impacted by returns, especially in Clothing and Electronics. Grocery brings in the highest sales with the lowest returns.
